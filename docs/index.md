## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at Brown University, interested in econometrics, statistics and machine learning. I am deeply passionate about solving complex practice problems with an engineering mindset -- improving algorithms, optimizing processes and uncovering hidden truths in real-world datasets to better understand the world around us.

Before joining Brown, I completed my undergraduate at the University of Cambridge and my master's degree at Imperial College London.
