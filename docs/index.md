## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at Brown University with interest in econometrics and machine learning. I am deeply passionate about solving complex real-world problems with an engineering mindset -- improving algorithms, optimizing processes and uncovering hidden facts in data to enable a better understand the world around us.

Before joining Brown, I completed my Bachelor's degree at the University of Cambridge and my Master's degree at Imperial College London.

## Research Interests

-   **Causal Inference**: high dimensional data, noisy environments, scalability to big data.
-   **Forecasting:** time series, prediction problems in finance and macroeconomics.
-   **Reinforcement Learning:** multi-armed bandit, contextual bandit, deep RL.

## Experiences

-   **[Jun-Aug, 2024]** Research assistant for Prof. Soonwoo Kwon and Prof. Jon Roth: wrote R package for inferring causal mechanisms, and constructed confidence intervals for high-dimensional linear regression.
-   **[Jun-Aug, 2023]** Research assistant for Prof. Andriy Norets: implemented Bayesian conditional mixture model with variable number of components in Stan.
-   **[Sep 2021 - Apr 2022]** Research assistant for Prof. Eric French and the Institute for Fiscal Studies: estimated structural models in MATLAB using simulated method of moments to study the economic dynamics of aging.
-   **[Sep 2021 - Feb 2022]** Research assistant for Prof. Kai Liu and Prof. Noriko Amano-Patino: conducted event studies on census data and used NLP to preprocess massive datasets.
-   **[Jun-Aug, 2019]** Summer intern at J.P. Morgan London: exposure to hedging, pricing and risk management of equities, FX and rates derivatives.
